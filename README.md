## üöÄ How to Use

1.  **Learn the Fundamentals**: If you are new to prompt engineering, start by reading the [`prompt-engineering-techniques.md`](./prompt-engineering-techniques.md) guide to understand the core concepts.
2.  **Explore the Prompt Catalog**: Browse the [`prompts.md`](./prompts.md) file to find prompts relevant to your needs.
3.  **Copy and Adapt**: Copy any prompt and modify it to fit your specific context. Replace placeholders like `[TOPIC]` or `[PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE]` with your details.
4.  **Combine and Innovate**: For complex tasks, try combining different techniques. For example, you can use a role prompt with a chain-of-thought approach for more nuanced and accurate responses.
